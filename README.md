### ü§î Process

1. Started with the CRA(TS template)

2. Configured RTK with redux-persist

3. Added basic structure for UI i.e. dropdown and input

4. Added axios to fetch result for repos and users

5. Then UI for repos and users

6. Some if's for repos/users to fetch result based on Entity type

7. Add debounce (calls only if the user has typed 3 char)

8. Clearing inputs etc will result on empty screen

9. Added minor responsiveness as were required

### ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èShortcomings

These are some of the things were required but didn't tried it due to personal commitments and time limitations:

1. Didn't used routes

2. UI was required to move, once user search something

3. Didn't cover most of loading, error boundries etc

4. Naming variable isn't at its best, as well as refactoring

5. Ignored TS at few places to speed up stuff
